###### Goal:
The goal is to create a model to predict which home loans will be bad loans (that is, will be defaulted on).

##### Example 2: High-Performance Predictive Modeling Using SAS&reg; Enterprise Miner&trade;

![alt text](../README_imgs/HPPredictiveModeling.png "HP Predictive Modeling")

###### Goal:
The goal is to create a model for a binary target that predicts which home loans are likely to be defaulted. This flow 
uses high-performance nodes in SAS Enterprise Miner. If you set up a grid environment, the high-performance nodes run in a 
distributed computing environment, enabling you to use a large number of observations and variables to train and assess a 
predictive in a shorter period of time. These high-performance nodes are built on multithreaded procedures, so you might see 
performance gain even when you run these nodes on single-machine mode.
