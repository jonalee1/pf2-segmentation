**Build and Deploy an ML App using PyCaret and Streamlit**

Customer analytics, which serves as the foundation for all marketing efforts, includes approaches such as predictive modeling, data visualization, information management, and segmentation. Customer segmentation and a product recommendation engine are employed effectively to maximize sales and conversions. We shall concentrate on customer segmentation in this project. Marketers can use segmentation to better customize their marketing efforts to different audience segments.

Customer segmentation is the process of breaking customers into multiple groups based on shared criteria in order for businesses to promote each group efficiently and appropriately. We'll be working on an end-to-end project in which we'll create a model with the help of the PyCaret library, Streamlit, GitHub, and the Streamlit cloud.

PyCaret is a Python-based low-code machine learning library that allows you to go from data preparation to model deployment in minutes in your preferred notebook environment. In this particular project, K means clustering will be used to segment the data. We shall then build a Streamlit application and deploy it on the Streamlit cloud by linking it to the GitHub repository containing our project.

**Data description**

The dataset that we will use for this project is a part of PyCaret datasets and is called ‘jewelry’. It comprises customer profiles with columns such as age, income, spending score, and savings, and we're aiming to classify customers based on these so that our marketing team can target potential product buyers.

 **Approach**

1. Importing the required libraries and packages
2. Open and edit the config file according to your dataset
3. Get the dataset
4. Setup PyCaret environment
5. Model Creation
6. Model Assigning
7. Plotting model
8. Making predictions
9. Saving Model
10. Creating streamlit application
11. Creating a Github repository for the project
12. Connecting Streamlit cloud to Github
13. Deploying the project
